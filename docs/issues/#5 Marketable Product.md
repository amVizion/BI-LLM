### Problem Statement

Today, BI-LLM is a general purpose tool that lacks a specific use case. This makes it difficult to promote the tool, grow its adoption, prioritize features, and deliver value. It also risks the successful design of experiments to improve predictions accuracy. Lack of specificity delivers shallow results, does not allow to create a deep understanding of the domain, and wastes time collecting data that will not be reused. Without an audience for the analysis it becomes difficult to get human evaluations for the quality of reports, and without funding the opportunities for innovation are limited. For example, improvements to existing reports depend on manual prompt engineering, while it would be possible to automated prompt optimization, finetunning models, or even train brand new large language models focused on numeric, and time series predictions from semi-structured data. 

Content creators face a multitude of challenges. Including deciding what topics to cover, how to present the content (selecting a title), and generate engagement from viewers. In particular, they want answers to the questions: what drives engagement, and how can they grow their channel. YouTube is a source of multimodal data that includes the title, and description of a video. The script, including the hook, chapters, climax, and call to action. The audio that uses entonations to capture attention, and communicate emotion. The video that includes scenary, performance, pace, and editing. And finally, the thumbnail that attracts viewers. Additionally, creators must consider the algorith, engagement metrics, and viewers comments to make a successful a video.

For creators, challenges don't stop there. The YouTube ecosystem is huge, with diverse audiences, and a plethora of niches. Each demographic has unique characteristics, interests, and shifting attention. Without guidance, creators must make decisions based on intuition. The rate of experimentation is slow, and stakes for success high as their livelihood depends on it. There is also little visbility on their competition, and niches causing them to miss growth opportunities, or make repeated errors from other creators. Finally, there is the issue of their industry or niche: tryining to keep pace on a constantly evolving landscape of news, trends, and preferences. For example, video is often the slowest format to communicate content. Often news start with a text, and only a handful of content gets translated into video, as it is the most expensive to produce, store, stream, and watch. Keeping pace with the development of their niche is more than a full-time job. It is not only the creator that looses, but also the viewer that does not get to see content that would otherwise have enjoyed.    

### Solution Overview

The product should have answers for two questions: what drives engagement, and how can I grow the channel? The section for the engagement is almost ready. It would start with an introduction of the channel's content. Then an engagement analysis section by vertical detailing what attributes are correlated to high engagement. Then a subsection, indicating what type of content to avoid. One possible enhancement, would be to include titles that encapsulate the attributes. A second distinction would be for correlated attributes to differentiate between the titles that correlate positively, to the ones that not. Also, for attributes that have a high variance indicate examples and that performed positively, versus the ones that not, and possibly explain the reason for the variance. An ideal explanation would include the correlation across verticals. For example, titles with a given emotion perform better if they are correlated with a specific topic.

The growth section would start by identifying the niche based on the titles. Next, it would explain what the comments appreciate from those channels. Clustering & summarization techniques could be used, or reuse, and train new verticals for the comments. Next, would be the topics that resonate the most with the audience, and even drew similarity with the ones from the creators library. Finally, metrics: how does engament compare to the competition, both historically (for previous content), and present content. This insights would give specific information to the creator about what the audience cares about, what content is already successful, and an idea of what is requried for the next level. It could even be possible to take the existing successul content, and improve it.
