The ideal customer experience is one where with a single click: data is fetched, the report generated, and the web app started. A second requirement is to identify the UI requirements when editing the report to add functionality. A final requirement is to gradually build additional features to support data multimodal data analysis.

As a first step, the data will be retrieved using google apis. Then, a config will be generated, and passed to generate the embeddings, and attribute scores. For a good customer experience the report can be ommitted. Instead, generated dynamically by the user using the web UI, where a list of prompt templates can be used to generate the report dynamically. Maybe using a separate app like a Google Doc.
