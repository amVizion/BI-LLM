# Reflection agent

There are four metrics to evaluate the results of the reflection agent: accuracy, neutrality, anomaly detection, and consistency. 

## Evaluation metrics

### Accuracy
- Mean Logarithmic Error (MLE): the average of the logarithmic differences between the predicted and actual values.
- Correlation: the degree of linear relationship between the predicted and actual values.
- Ranking: average difference between the ranking of the predicted and actual values.

### Neutrality
- Median balance: number of prediction values above the median, and below the median.
- Quartile balance: number of prediction values in the first, and fourth quartiles.

### Anomaly detection
- Quartile detection: number of prediction values in the first, and fourth quartiles.
- Max/min distance: distance between the maximum and minimum values, and the predictions.
- Top/bottom 5 mean views: average number of views for the top and bottom 5 predictions.

### Consistency
- Mean difference: average difference between the first, and second prediction.
- Top 10 proportion: percentage of loss in videos with top 10 difference.
