# Niche Analysis

## Open problems
1. Individual representation of the channel.
2. Clustering & segmentation of niches.

There are two important concepts to consider, both related to area.
The first, when summarizing the channel measure the density of the content. 
The second, when segmenting the niches, the area of each cluster. 

## Channel summarization

A simple arithmetic of channel summarization would require:
- [x] Aggregate all channel's videos into embeddings.
- [x] Inference pipeline that takes all channels, and computes correlations.
- [x] Cluster view that displays all channels.
- [x] Set of prompts to analyze clusters.

## Niche segmentation

Niches will be a new category of the Data Store: called ClusterStore (handled on a separate issue).
That can be reused for future analysis (also handled in a different issue).

## Report

- [ ] Starts with a description of the clusters.
- [ ] Next, talks about the strenghts across clusters.
- [ ] Finally, highlight how the channel attributes maximize performance.
