# September Roadmap

### Priorities

1. Improve the analytical capabilities of the library.
2. Develop the first distribution channel for the library.
3. Prepare web-hosted version of the library.
4. Write research paper.

## Library improvements

- [ ] Support hierarchical items. Analyze, visualize, and describe groupped items.
- [ ] Enhance reporting. Spliting descriptive paragraphs from analytical insights.
- [ ] Label analysis. Describe, and explain for a given label what drives success.

Enhance reporting is a comparatively simple process that demonstrates value, and elevates the weakest feature. 
If not doing it now it will be more complicated with time.

Hierarchical analysis is a much desired feature. With benefits to marketing, and investing data.
But is also more complex, and the parameters to complete it are not yet defined.
Analysis on labels is a good idea, but still raw, and only adds tangential value.

By only bringing forth 3 features, there could be time to advance other priorities.

### Backlog

- [ ] RAG support.
- [ ] Multi-agents analysis.
- [ ] Federated learning.

## Distribution channels

- [ ] Static website hosting YouTube insights.
- [ ] Web-hosted LinkedIn analytics.
- [ ] Content strategy.

LinkedIn analytics will be the first distribution channel for the library. 
It has an easier distribution strategy, and code reusable for October's launch.
Also, not developing content gives an edge YouTube growth efforts.

## Web hosting requirements

- [ ] A library of labels, and predictors. 
- [ ] End-to-end customer experience design.
- [ ] ChatGPT single-prompt to perform full analysis. 
- [ ] Marketing copywriting for the landing page.
