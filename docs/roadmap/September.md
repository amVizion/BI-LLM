# September Roadmap

### Priorities

1. Improve the analytical capabilities of the library.
2. Develop the first distribution channel for the library.
3. Prepare web-hosted version of the library.
4. Write research paper.

## Library improvements

- [ ] Support hierarchical items. Analyze, visualize, and describe groupped items.
- [x] Enhance reporting. Spliting descriptive paragraphs from analytical insights.
- [ ] Label analysis. Describe, and explain for a given label what drives success.

Enhance reporting is a comparatively simple process that demonstrates value, and elevates the weakest feature. 
If not doing it now it will be more complicated with time.

Hierarchical analysis is a much desired feature. With benefits to marketing, and investing data.
But is also more complex, and the parameters to complete it are not yet defined.
Analysis on labels is a good idea, but still raw, and only adds tangential value.

By only bringing forth 3 features, there could be time to advance other priorities.

### Backlog

- [ ] RAG support.
- [ ] Multi-agents analysis.
- [ ] Federated learning.

## Distribution channels

- [ ] Static website hosting YouTube insights.
- [ ] Web-hosted LinkedIn analytics.
- [ ] Content strategy.

LinkedIn analytics will be the first distribution channel for the library. 
It has an easier distribution strategy, and code reusable for October's launch.
Also, not developing content gives an edge YouTube growth efforts.

## Web hosting requirements

- [x] A library of labels, and predictors. 
- [ ] End-to-end customer experience design.
- [ ] ChatGPT single-prompt to perform full analysis. 
- [ ] Marketing copywriting for the landing page.

## September 20

**Reassessment of priorities:** 

1. The analytical capabilities of the library have been drastically improved by enabling predictions based on the data analysis. Measuring accuracy provides the foundation to continue improving analytical capabilities. Notably, the proposed strategy also introduces a breaktrough to train large language models beyond amVizion current capabilities.

2. The first distribution channel for the library will be probably be content for a developer, and resarcher audience. This is a good strategy to build a community around the library, and hopefully accelerate development by recruiting talent. It is also a light-weight strategy that can be implemented in parallel with development. Content will be based on the outputs of research, and data for the first essay is already available. Introduction of the essay, and its structure are also completed. The essay could be launched as soon as this weekend.

3. Prepare web-hosted version of the library also shows a significant progress where the technical foundations would be ready as next month. In particular the Attribute of Labels, and the dynamic chat experience to generate prompts are the building blocks for supporting an end-to-end customer experience. However, marketing, product, and sales requirements makes it less likely that progress, and investment will be focused on this area. The launch date of a web-hosted version of the library is undefined.

4. Finally, the research paper shows the most significant progress. It's also causing the most excitment. Title is defined, experiment setup as well, and results are anticipated to show value. Contributions need to be enlisted, but one of them is showing a major deficiency in model capabilities, and propose a related training strategy to mitigate those shortcommings.

### Recommendation

Focus on the Q4 business strategy of the library. Then, on October write a related roadmap for the library. Finish the month, prioritizing the content strategy, and research paper. Complement it with cold outreach focused on sales.
